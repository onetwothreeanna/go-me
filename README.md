Go-Me is a productivity app that focuses on accomplishments rather than to-do lists.  

During my time as as a Visiting Professor of Art, I noticed my colleagues and I fell into a trap of measuring
self-worth based on how infinite we could make our to-do lists.  Instead of encouraging productivity, however, 
the result of these endless to-do's often became guilt, stress, and imposter syndrome.  

Go-Me aims to encourage us to emphasize positivity while also allowing us to reflect on which parts of life could use more attention.

Users sign up for accounts, create categories for areas in life they hope to see progress or changes, 
and update those categories with tasks completed.

Keep track of anything in life ranging from big projects at work to watering plants, 
from exercise to meditation, from building new skills to making more time for leisure.
